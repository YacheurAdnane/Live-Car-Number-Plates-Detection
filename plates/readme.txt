The 'plates' folder in this repository is intentionally left empty as a placeholder for storing the recognized license plate images. During the execution of the live license plate recognition algorithm, any successfully detected license plates will be saved as individual image files in the 'plates' folder.

The empty 'plates' folder allows for easy organization and retrieval of the recognized license plate images. As soon as the algorithm detects a license plate, it will save a snapshot of the plate as a separate image file in this folder. This enables further analysis, archiving, or post-processing of the recognized license plates.

Please note that at the moment, the folder may appear empty since no license plates have been detected or saved yet. However, as the algorithm runs and identifies license plates, the 'plates' folder will gradually populate with the corresponding license plate images.

Feel free to check back later or during the execution of the algorithm to see the recognized license plate images being saved in the 'plates' folder.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your interest in our live license plate recognition algorithm
